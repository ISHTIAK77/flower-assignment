    <h1>Introduction to Web Development Summer
        Camp
        </h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
    <p>In our interconnected and rapidly advancing world,
        digital literacy is an essential skill for everyone, regardless of their field of study or
        career aspirations.
        Recognizing this need, we at the C3 Club have designed an accessible and
        comprehensive course titled "Introduction to Web Development." This program is
        open to all students, regardless of their majors, and is prepared to provide a unique
        blend of theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in the exciting world of
        web development.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Our Goal</h3>
        <p>Our primary goal is to enable students from diverse disciplines to gain valuable skills
            and broaden their horizons. For Computer Science and Technology (CST/MCST) and
            Electronic Information Engineering (EIE) or Information and Communication
            Engineering (ICE) students, this course is prepared to provide a solid foundation in
            coding and programming, essential to their respective fields. For students pursuing
            Business Administration (BBA) and Master of Business Administration (MBA), the
            course will offer insight into website design and a glimpse into the future of digital
            business.
            </p>
        <h3>Our Objectives</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To introduce participants to the fundamentals of web development.</li>
            <li>To provide CST/MCST and EIE/ICE students with practical coding and
                programming skills.</li>
           <li>To give BBA and MBA students a working knowledge of website design and
            the role of digital platforms in contemporary business.</li>
            <li>To foster cross-disciplinary communication and cooperation among students</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>

    <h1><b> <i>Post Summer Camp</i></b></h1>
    <p>Students who demonstrated exceptional competence in the summer camp will be
        recruited to teach new students class-based programming languages for the next
        semester. <br> Students who wish to enhance their web development skills will also be
        guided by mentors (no classes will be provided for web development, except for some
        workshops).</p>
